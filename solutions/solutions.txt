Cloud-Hosted Dashboard + GitHub App Integration

    Flow:

        Your app hosts the dashboard.

        Users log in (OAuth) and connect a repo via a GitHub App.

        Changes made through UI create a branch/PR via GitHub API.

    Tech: OAuth + GitHub App + GitHub API.

    Notes: How to make PRs/commits without cloning the code? Is it possible?



Self-Hosted Dashboard + patcher via Docker or CLI

    Flow:

        Dev runs a CLI or Docker container that spins up the dashboard and handles Git operations.

        Non-tech uses it locally or via VPN.

        Changes commit/push directly.

    Notes: Open source solution



Pull-Based Git Flow

    Flow:

        Your hosted dashboard just outputs a diff/patch or file.

        Devs pull changes manually (or on cron) via a CLI, apply them locally.

        Can be automated in CI.

    Notes: No instant feedback, total privacy,
