# Portal üåÄ

A no-code tool to edit existing codebases, the developers way.

**Portal** parses your code looking for *@portal* comments, then serves a web-based dashboard to edit, preview and push changes.

1. Annotate the code you want to be editable.
    ```js
    //@portal
    let minItems = 2;
    ```

2. Spin up the Portal container locally or in your cloud environment, configuring repo access and users.

    `docker run portal -p 8080:8080 -e REPO_NAME=myrepo -e GITHUB_USERNAME=myname -e PAC=mytoken`

3. Log into the web dashboard and edit your project.

## Features
- Interactive, user friendly no-code dashboard.
- Total customization and limitation of code interaction.
- Seamless remote repo integration.
- For frontends, real time UI preview.


## Syntax

### Variable portal
Makes the annotated variable editable in the web dashboard.
```js
//@portal
let minItems = 2;
```

### All variables portal
Makes all variables under the annotation in the current file editable.
```js
//@portal all

let minItems = 2;

const maxItems = 10;
```

### UI variables portal
If there is a React/Tailwind component tree, it makes all CSS parameters in the component tree editable.
```js
//@portal ui

return (
    <div className="h-8 w-8">
        <span className="flex mt-8">
        ...
);
```

### UI mocks
You may want to mock certain component variables for correct preview rendering, like props or context.
You can provide any javascript type or object as mock value.
```js
//@portal ui mock "dn309db2lc0r4bf82" false {gamesWon: 2, points: 200}
function PlayerCard({uid, isPremium, stats}) {
    //@portal mock {name: "Flipper", difficulty: "medium"}
    const game = useGameStore(state => state.game);
    ...
}
```

If you have big objects, you can specify them in the mocks.json file.
`mocks.json`
```json
{
    "event": {
        "name": "Together Raver",
        "type": "Free party",
        "maxGuests": 2000,
        "dresscode": "Casual",
    }
}
```

```js
//@portal ui mock event
function EventData({eventData}) {
    ...
}
```

## Server configuration

The server can be configured via env variables.
The scope of the configuration are remote repo access and dashboard authentication.
