Portal

A non technical can interact with an existing codebase by portals created by developers.

A developer could annotate/comment certain parts of code to indicate certain modifications by non technicals. The developer decides the boundaries and effects of such intervention.


Let's start with javascript only for simplicity, annotations are made via comments/javadocs.


Code level interactions:

- Change variable assignment values
- Change conditions


User interaction examples:

- Change UI components (color, size, opacity, padding, margins, borders, whatever...)
- Change application constants (max number of bookings, timeouts, ecc...)
